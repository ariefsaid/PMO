# Auth Specification: Real Supabase Auth (Issue #3)

> **Status:** Module spec for Issue #3 — "replace mock `UserContext` with real Supabase Auth". Synthesized
> from `target-architecture.spec.md §7/§2.3/§10`, `baseline.spec.md §5.1/§5.2`, `supabase/migrations/0002_rls.sql`,
> `supabase/seed.sql`, and the Director's locked decisions. Conforms to house conventions (`CLAUDE.md`):
> EARS requirements `FR-AUTH-###`, Given/When/Then acceptance criteria `AC-###` (each → one `e2e/<AC>.spec.ts`).
>
> **Owner is AFK.** Reasonable assumptions are made and flagged `[OWNER-DECISION]` where the owner should
> confirm before production cutover. No requirement is blocked on the owner.
>
> **Amendment (demo-org restriction, post-#3):** the impersonation control is now scoped to Admins of a
> **demo** org (`organizations.lifecycle_state = 'demo'`, migration 0191). FR-AUTH-033/034/035 + AC-AUTH-010/011
> below carry the original (any-org Admin) contract; the restriction is FR-AUTH-036..038 + AC-AUTH-013..015.

## 1. Scope

### 1.1 In scope (this issue)
Replace the client-side **role-simulation** auth (`OBS-AUTH-001..006`) with **real Supabase Auth (GoTrue)**:
- Typed Supabase browser client (`src/lib/supabase/client.ts`) reading env config.
- A real session + profile + role context (`AuthProvider` / `useAuth`) replacing mock `UserContext`.
- `BrowserRouter` (was `HashRouter`, `OBS-NAV-003`), a `/login` route, and an unauthenticated-redirect route guard.
- Nav role-gating (`Sidebar`/`Header`) driven by the **real** role from `profiles.role`.
- The Header role-switch dropdown re-cast as an **Admin-only client-side impersonation** ("view as role") control.
- Real credentialed GoTrue seed users so each seeded profile can actually sign in (dev only).

### 1.2 Out of scope (later issues — do NOT implement here)
- The full data-access layer (`src/lib/db/*`) and swapping any page's business data mock→real (**Issue #4**).
  Pages keep reading `data/mockData.ts` for business data; **only the user/role identity** comes from Supabase.
- Password reset, MFA, OAuth/social providers (future — §8).
- The `app_metadata.role` JWT fast-path claim and its profiles→claim sync trigger. `auth_role()` in
  `0002_rls.sql` reads `profiles.role` and is **unchanged by this issue** (see §6, future per that file's note).

### 1.3 Relationship to existing code
- `context/UserContext.tsx`, `App.tsx` (`HashRouter`), `components/Header.tsx` (role-switch), `components/Sidebar.tsx`
  (role gate), `index.tsx` are the AS-IS surfaces being replaced/rewired. `pmo-portal/src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts`
  already exists (generated); the client and context consume `Database` / `Tables<'profiles'>` from it.
- `0001_init_schema.sql` (`profiles`, default org `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`) and `0002_rls.sql`
  (`auth_org_id()`/`auth_role()` read `profiles`; RLS needs `auth.uid()`) are already authored. This issue makes
  `auth.uid()` real (a logged-in GoTrue user) so those policies resolve against a genuine session.

---

## 2. Design decisions (baked in)

| # | Decision | Source / rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D-1 | Auth methods: **email/password + magic link**. | Director locked; `target-architecture §7.1`. |
| D-2 | Email confirmations **OFF for dev** (`config.toml auth.email.enable_confirmations = false`, already set). | Director locked. `[OWNER-DECISION]` enable for pre-prod/prod (§7). |
| D-3 | Typed singleton client at `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`, env-driven (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`). | Director locked; `target-architecture §2.2`, ADR-0002 (anon key public by design). |
| D-4 | `profiles.role` is the **authoritative** role. No JWT role claim wired this issue. | `0002_rls.sql` comment (claim fast-path removed pending signed claim + audited sync). |
| D-5 | `AuthProvider`/`useAuth` replace `UserContext`/`useUser`; subscribe to `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange`; load the signed-in user's `profiles` row; expose `currentUser`, `role`, `signOut`, `signInWithPassword`, `signInWithMagicLink`. | Director locked; `target-architecture §7.3`. |
| D-6 | `BrowserRouter` + `/login` route + `RequireAuth` guard (unauthenticated → `/login`). | Director locked; `target-architecture §10`, `FR-ARCH-004`. |
| D-7 | Header role-switch → **Admin-only impersonation** ("view as role"); non-Admins do not see it; **client-side view only** (does NOT change RLS/server identity). | Director locked. **Limitation flagged** in §3.4 + AC-AUTH-010. |
| D-8 | Real credentialed GoTrue seed users replace bare `auth.users` rows; dev credentials documented. | Director locked; `seed.sql` NOTE. |

### 2.1 Identity / role mapping (mock → real)
- Mock `User` (`types.ts`, numeric `id`) is **not** the auth identity going forward. The authenticated user
  is a `profiles` row (`Tables<'profiles'>`: `id: uuid = auth.users.id`, `full_name`, `email`, `avatar_url`,
  `role: user_role`). `useAuth().currentUser` is the `profiles` row; `useAuth().role` is `profiles.role`.
- `Sidebar`/`Header` consume `role` (the `user_role` string enum `'Executive' | 'Project Manager' | 'Finance'
  | 'Engineer' | 'Admin'`) — same string values as the existing `UserRole` enum, so nav-gating logic is preserved.

---

## 3. Functional requirements (EARS)

### 3.1 Client & configuration
- **FR-AUTH-001** (ubiquitous) The system shall expose a single typed Supabase browser client created from
  `import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, typed with the generated
  `Database` type. *(D-3)*
- **FR-AUTH-002** (event-driven) When either `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` or `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is missing at
  module load, the system shall throw a descriptive error rather than construct a client with `undefined` config. *(fail-fast; NFR-DEPLOY-001)*
- **FR-AUTH-003** (ubiquitous) The system shall never embed the Supabase service-role key in the browser bundle;
  only the anon key is used client-side. *(ADR-0002; NFR-SEC-002)*

### 3.2 Session & role context
- **FR-AUTH-010** (event-driven) When the application mounts, the system shall read any persisted Supabase session
  and, if present, load the matching `profiles` row before rendering protected routes. *(replaces `OBS-AUTH-001`)*
- **FR-AUTH-011** (event-driven) When the Supabase auth state changes (sign-in / sign-out / token refresh), the
  system shall update the in-memory session, profile, and role accordingly. *(subscribe to `onAuthStateChange`)*
- **FR-AUTH-012** (state-driven) While a session exists but its `profiles` row is still loading, the system shall
  render a loading state and shall not render protected business routes.
- **FR-AUTH-013** (event-driven) When `useAuth` is called outside an `AuthProvider`, the system shall throw
  `"useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider"`. *(parallels `OBS-AUTH-005`)*
- **FR-AUTH-014** (state-driven) While authenticated, the system shall expose `currentUser` (the `profiles` row),
  `role` (`profiles.role`), `session`, `signInWithPassword`, `signInWithMagicLink`, and `signOut` via `useAuth()`. *(D-5)*

### 3.3 Authentication flows
- **FR-AUTH-020** (event-driven) When a user submits valid email + password on `/login`, the system shall establish
  an authenticated session and navigate to `/` (the dashboard). *(`FR-AUTH-001` target-arch)*
- **FR-AUTH-021** (event-driven) When a user submits invalid credentials on `/login`, the system shall display an
  inline error and shall not navigate away from `/login`.
- **FR-AUTH-022** (event-driven) When a user requests a magic link with a valid email on `/login`, the system shall
  call `signInWithMagicLink` and display a "check your email" confirmation; completing the emailed link shall
  establish a session and land on `/`. *(testable via local Inbucket, `config.toml inbucket` port 54324)*
- **FR-AUTH-023** (event-driven) When a user signs out, the system shall clear the Supabase session and route to
  `/login`. *(`FR-AUTH-004` target-arch; replaces no-op mock)*
- **FR-AUTH-024** (event-driven) When the application reloads while a valid session exists, the system shall restore
  the session without re-prompting. *(replaces reset-on-refresh `OBS-AUTH-006`; `FR-AUTH-005` target-arch)*

### 3.4 Routing, guards & role gating
- **FR-AUTH-030** (ubiquitous) The system shall use `BrowserRouter`. *(replaces `HashRouter`, `OBS-NAV-003`; `FR-UI-001`)*
- **FR-AUTH-031** (state-driven) While unauthenticated, the system shall redirect any protected route to `/login`,
  including direct deep-link navigation. *(`FR-ARCH-004`; closes the cosmetic-only gating gap, `baseline §5.2` note)*
- **FR-AUTH-032** (ubiquitous) The system shall render sidebar/header nav items based on the **real** `role`,
  preserving the existing role→nav mapping (`OBS-NAV-001/002`): Engineer sees no Sales/Procurement/Companies/Reports
  and no Administration; Executive/Admin see Administration.
- **FR-AUTH-033** (state-driven) While the current role is `Admin` **and** the signed-in org is a demo org, the system shall render an impersonation
  ("View as role") control offering the four non-Admin roles; otherwise the system shall not render that control.
  The demo org signal is the caller's own `organizations.lifecycle_state = 'demo'` (migration 0191), read under
  the org-scoped SELECT policy — never a hardcoded org id. *(D-7 as restricted by FR-AUTH-036; replaces `OBS-AUTH-002/003`)*
- **FR-AUTH-034** (event-driven) When an Admin selects a role in the impersonation control, the system shall change
  the **client-side displayed role** (driving nav gating and any role-branched view) without changing the Supabase
  session or any server identity. *(D-7)*
- **FR-AUTH-035** (ubiquitous) The system shall treat impersonation as **view-only**: it shall not alter `auth.uid()`,
  the JWT, or RLS evaluation, and any future server data fetch shall still execute under the Admin's real identity.
  **Limitation:** impersonation cannot preview another user's row-level data; it only previews role-gated UI. *(D-7)*
- **FR-AUTH-036** (state-driven) While the signed-in org's `lifecycle_state` is not `'demo'` (live, test, NULL, or an
  unrecognized value), the system shall not render the impersonation control for any Admin, on desktop and mobile
  surfaces alike, and a role selection attempt shall not change the displayed role.
- **FR-AUTH-037** (state-driven) While the org lifecycle read is unresolved — loading or errored — the system shall
  treat the org as **not** demo (fail closed): the impersonation control is not rendered and no role selection applies.
- **FR-AUTH-038** (event-driven) When demo eligibility disappears while a view-as role is selected, the system shall
  revert the displayed role to the real role immediately and clear the stored selection, so a later re-eligibility
  never resurrects it.

### 3.5 Seed
- **FR-AUTH-040** (ubiquitous) The system shall seed real credentialed GoTrue users (one per seeded profile) so each
  profile can sign in locally; the profiles FK (`profiles.id → auth.users.id`) shall resolve after a fresh reset. *(D-8; replaces bare `auth.users` in `seed.sql`)*
- **FR-AUTH-041** (ubiquitous) Seeded dev credentials shall be documented (in `.env.example` / a seed note) and shall
  exist only in the local seed path — never in production seeds. *(`[OWNER-DECISION]` prod seeding strategy, §7)*

---

## 4. Non-functional requirements

- **NFR-AUTH-SEC-001** No secrets committed: `.env.local` is gitignored; only `.env.example` (placeholder/local-dev
  values) is committed; no service-role key client-side. *(NFR-SEC-002, NFR-DEPLOY-001)*
- **NFR-AUTH-SEC-002** Authorization remains server-enforced by RLS; client-side guards/impersonation are UX only and
  non-authoritative. *(NFR-SEC-001; FR-AUTH-035)*
- **NFR-AUTH-TEST-001** The session/role context and `RequireAuth` guard shall be unit-tested with a mocked Supabase
  client (no network). The login→dashboard→sign-out flow and deep-link redirect shall be covered by Playwright e2e
  against the local Supabase stack.
- **NFR-AUTH-UX-001** `/login` and the auth-loading state shall handle loading/error states (no blank screens, no
  unhandled promise rejections); keyboard-operable form controls (WCAG AA, `FR-UI-002`).

---

## 5. Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)

> Each maps 1:1 to `e2e/<AC-id>.spec.ts` (Playwright) **except** AC-AUTH-007/008 (session/guard plumbing) and
> AC-AUTH-013/014/015 (demo-eligibility gating — client-side state logic) which are unit-level (Vitest, mocked
> client) and are noted as such. e2e AC require the local Supabase stack running (`supabase start`) + `npm run dev`.

**AC-AUTH-001 — Unauthenticated user is redirected to /login** (FR-AUTH-031) *(e2e)*
Given no active session
When I navigate to `/`
Then I am redirected to `/login` and the sign-in form is shown.

**AC-AUTH-002 — Protected deep-link blocked when logged out** (FR-AUTH-031) *(e2e)*
Given no active session
When I navigate directly to `/projects/40000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`
Then I am redirected to `/login` (no project data renders).

**AC-AUTH-003 — Valid password login lands on dashboard with correct role** (FR-AUTH-020, FR-AUTH-032) *(e2e)*
Given I am on `/login`
When I sign in as `pm@acme.test` with the seeded password
Then I land on `/`, the header shows "Alice Manager" / "Project Manager", and the sidebar shows Projects, Sales Pipeline, Procurement, Timesheets (Project Manager nav set).

**AC-AUTH-004 — Invalid credentials show an error and stay on /login** (FR-AUTH-021) *(e2e)*
Given I am on `/login`
When I submit `pm@acme.test` with a wrong password
Then an inline error is shown and the URL is still `/login`.

**AC-AUTH-005 — Magic-link login completes via local inbox** (FR-AUTH-022) *(e2e, local stack + Inbucket)*
Given I am on `/login`
When I request a magic link for `engineer@acme.test`, open the email in the local Inbucket (port 54324), and follow the link
Then I land on `/` authenticated as "Dave Engineer".

**AC-AUTH-006 — Sign-out returns to /login** (FR-AUTH-023) *(e2e)*
Given I am signed in and on `/`
When I click "Sign out"
Then I am routed to `/login` and navigating back to `/` redirects to `/login`.

**AC-AUTH-007 — useAuth exposes profile + role from the session** (FR-AUTH-010, FR-AUTH-014) *(unit, mocked client)*
Given a mocked Supabase client returning a session for `00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000a2` and a `profiles` row with role "Project Manager"
When a component renders inside `AuthProvider` and reads `useAuth()`
Then `currentUser.full_name === "Alice Manager"` and `role === "Project Manager"`.

**AC-AUTH-008 — RequireAuth renders children only when authenticated** (FR-AUTH-012, FR-AUTH-031) *(unit, mocked client)*
Given `RequireAuth` wrapping a protected element
When the mocked client reports no session
Then it renders a redirect to `/login` (not the protected element); when it reports a session + loaded profile, it renders the protected element.

**AC-AUTH-009 — Engineer role hides Administration and restricted nav** (FR-AUTH-032) *(e2e)*
Given I am signed in as `engineer@acme.test` (Engineer)
When I view the sidebar
Then Sales Pipeline, Procurement, Companies, Reports, and Administration are hidden, and Dashboard, Projects, Timesheets, Tasks are shown.

**AC-AUTH-010 — Demo-org Admin sees impersonation and can view as a role (client-side)** (FR-AUTH-033, FR-AUTH-034, FR-AUTH-035) *(e2e; demo precondition per FR-AUTH-036 — the seeded org is `'demo'` via migration 0191)*
Given I am signed in as `admin@acme.test` (Admin of the demo org)
When I open the "View as role" control and select "Engineer"
Then the sidebar updates to the Engineer nav set; the underlying session/identity is unchanged (signing out still works and the real account stays Admin).

**AC-AUTH-011 — Non-Admin does not see the impersonation control** (FR-AUTH-033) *(e2e)*
Given I am signed in as `finance@acme.test` (Finance)
When I view the header
Then no "View as role" / impersonation control is rendered.

**AC-AUTH-012 — Session persists across reload** (FR-AUTH-024) *(e2e)*
Given I am signed in and on `/`
When I reload the page
Then I remain on `/` authenticated (no redirect to `/login`, no re-prompt).

**AC-AUTH-013 — Non-demo-org Admin is denied the impersonation control everywhere** (FR-AUTH-036) *(unit, mocked client)*
Given an Admin whose own org's `lifecycle_state` resolves to `'live'` (same denial for `'test'`/NULL/unknown)
When the header renders on desktop and the mobile account menu opens
Then no "View as role" control or role menu items exist on either surface, the displayed role stays the real role,
and a role-selection attempt does not change it.

**AC-AUTH-014 — Org state unresolved fails closed** (FR-AUTH-037) *(unit, mocked client)*
Given the org lifecycle read is pending or has errored
When an Admin's shell renders
Then the eligibility is treated as not-demo: no control renders and no selection applies, until the read resolves to `'demo'`.

**AC-AUTH-015 — Stale view-as selection reverts and never resurrects** (FR-AUTH-038) *(unit, mocked client)*
Given a demo-org Admin viewing as Engineer
When the org stops being demo
Then the displayed role reverts to Admin immediately, and when eligibility later returns the displayed role is still
Admin (the selection was cleared, not masked).

---

## 6. RLS / tenancy interaction (no schema change this issue)

- `0002_rls.sql` `auth_org_id()` and `auth_role()` read `profiles` keyed on `auth.uid()`. Making auth real means
  `auth.uid()` is a genuine logged-in GoTrue user, so every existing policy now evaluates against a real identity.
- **This issue does not modify migrations or RLS.** It does **not** add the `app_metadata.role` JWT claim or a
  profiles→claim sync trigger (that returns in a later issue per the `0002_rls.sql` note). `profiles.role` stays
  authoritative (D-4).
- `org_id` seam: untouched — column default (`0001`) + `WITH CHECK` (`0002`) keep `org_id` client-unspoofable.
  Seeded profiles all belong to the single default org, so tenant isolation is a structurally-present no-op (per
  `target-architecture §6.4`).
- Demo restriction read (post-#3 amendment): the impersonation gate reads `organizations.lifecycle_state` (migration
  0191) through the existing org-scoped SELECT policy — the caller's own org row only, `org_id` never sent from the
  client. No RLS or schema change; `NULL` and unrecognized state values are treated as not-demo (mirroring the
  server-side `assert_org_destroyable` allowlist posture).

---

## 7. `[OWNER-DECISION]` flags (confirm before pre-prod / prod)

- **`[OWNER-DECISION]` D-2 / prod email confirmations:** dev runs with `enable_confirmations = false`. Before
  pre-prod, enable email confirmation (and configure a real SMTP provider in `config.toml [auth.email.smtp]`).
- **`[OWNER-DECISION]` D-8 / prod seeding:** real credentialed users with documented passwords are **dev-only**.
  Production user provisioning (invite flow / admin-created accounts, no shared passwords) is a separate decision.
- **`[OWNER-DECISION]` impersonation in prod:** Admin client-side "view as role" is a UX convenience that does NOT
  preview row-level data (FR-AUTH-035). Confirm whether a server-side impersonation (e.g. audited, RLS-aware) is
  ever required; if so it becomes its own issue.
- **`[OWNER-DECISION]` post-login redirect target:** assumed `/` (dashboard). Confirm whether deep-link "return to
  intended URL after login" is desired (deferred to a follow-up; see §8).

---

## 8. Future / deferred

- `app_metadata.role` JWT claim + audited profiles→claim sync trigger (re-enables `auth_role()` fast-path).
- Password reset, MFA, OAuth/social providers.
- "Return to originally-requested URL after login" (currently always lands on `/`).
- CI wiring for Playwright against an ephemeral Supabase stack (this issue brings e2e live locally; CI is a follow-up).
