/**
 * adapter-dispatch — Deno Edge Function entry point (ADR-0055 P0/P1, FR-EAS-023/033/042, FR-CUA-001).
 *
 * Thin wiring ONLY — the ordered write-through orchestration lives in the pure
 * `dispatchExternallyOwnedWrite` (pmo-portal/src/lib/adapterSeam/dispatch.ts), unit-tested under
 * dispatch.test.ts. This file is INTEGRATION-ONLY (not unit-tested) — verified by `deno check` +
 * the boot-smoke (the same contract as agent-dispatch/compose-view, ADR-0039/0044).
 *
 * Order (AC-EAS-033): org from JWT → adapter select → command invoke (NO org_id, AC-EAS-023) →
 * read-model update (service role) → external_refs record → return.
 *
 * `verify_jwt = true` (supabase/config.toml): the Supabase gateway already rejects an invalid/
 * missing JWT before this handler runs. The handler still resolves the CALLER's identity + org
 * itself — via a caller-JWT-scoped client (deputy auth, NOT service_role), the same
 * profiles-lookup-under-RLS pattern as compose-view/handler.ts Recon #4 — because the adapter
 * must NEVER receive org_id (FR-EAS-024): org context is bound HERE, above the adapter, and used
 * only for the machine-write helpers (read-model upsert + external_refs record), never passed
 * into `adapter.commit()`.
 *
 * P1 (ClickUp, Slice B): the `tasks` domain resolves its per-project external container binding +
 * status/member maps from `external_project_bindings` (service role) at request time, so its factory is async and
 * receives the caller's org + the parsed command — unlike the P0 `reference` factory (no args). The
 * `writeReadModel` helper below branches per `command.domain`: `tasks` upserts/updates the `tasks`
 * read-model row directly (mirroring ClickUp's completion date, FR-CUA-030 Finding 6); every other
 * domain keeps the P0 `external_reference_items` behavior byte-for-byte.
